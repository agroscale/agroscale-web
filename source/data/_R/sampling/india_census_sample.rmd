# Census based cluster-sample in India

Anurag Ajay

## Introduction

This is what will be done here

## Get data

```{r sampindia01}
library(readxl)
x <- read_excel("PCA1001_2011_MDDS.xlsx")[, 1:10]
head(x)
dim(x)
table(x$Level)
district <- unique(x[x$Level == "DISTRICT", "Name"])
district
```

## Population weighted sample of villages

```{r sampindia10}
villages <- x[x$Level == "VILLAGE" & x$TRU == "Rural", ]
dim(x)
samplesize <- 40

i <- sample(nrow(villages), samplesize, prob=villages$No_HH)
sel_villages <- villages[i, c(1:4, 7:10)]
```

Put the sub-district name back in

```{r sampindia20}
subdist <- unique(x[x$Level == "SUB-DISTRICT", c("Subdistt", "Name")])
subdist
colnames(subdist)[2] <- "Subdist"
sel_villages <- merge(sel_villages, subdist, by="Subdistt")
head(sel_villages)
```

Write to .csv (for use in excel)

```{r sampindia30}
sel_villages <- sel_villages[, c("State", "District", "Subdistt", "Town/Village", "Subdist", "Name", "No_HH")]

sel_villages <- sel_villages[order(sel_villages$Subdist, sel_villages$Name), ]

filename <- paste0(district, "_selected-villages.csv")
filename
write.csv(sel_villages, filename, row.names = FALSE)
head(read.csv(filename))
```
