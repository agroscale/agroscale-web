Spatial data 
============

This chapter provides descriptions of some of the most relevant spatial data resources. The number of data sources available is very large, and growing. Our selection is biased towards the data used in this book. There are chapters environmental data: `climate <climate.html>`_ data and `soil <soil.html>`_ data, and on land use: `crop area, yield, and calendars <crops.html>`_, as well as on `population density <population.html>`_, `administrative boundaries <boundaries.html>`_ and `infrastructure (roads) <osm.html>`_.
