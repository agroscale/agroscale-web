Spatial data 
============

This chapter provides descriptions of some of the most relevant spatial data resources. With a bias toward the data used in this book. There are pages on `climate <climate.html>`_, `soil <soil.html>`_, `crop area, yield, and calendars <crops.html>`_, and `infrastructure (roads) <osm.html>`_.

Administrative boundaries for all countries are available from `GADM <https://www.gadm.org>`_.
