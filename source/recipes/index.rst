In this section we show the application of tools and methods to produce intermediate data products. These intermediate products do not directly answer a question. Rather they can be used as a data source in research, and their use is illustrated in the next section (case studies).

In the first chapter a combination of machine learning and mechanistic models is used to estimate input (fertilizer) and output (maize) prices. The second chapter discussed approaches to estimate crop calendars (planting and harvesting times).
Chapter three shows approaches to estimate yield potential using simulation and regression models. Chapter four shows an example of an empirical "big data" approach to estimate the response to fertilizer. In the final chapter, approaches to estimating climate change effects are discussed.
