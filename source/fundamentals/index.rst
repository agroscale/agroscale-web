Fundamentals
============

In this section we show the application of tools and methods to produce intermediate data products. They are organized by the questions *Where*, *When*, *What*, *How*, and *Who*. The idea is that the answers to these questions provide data products that can help us answering the more imporant questions *Why* and *What if* -- but we leave these to another section (case studies).

In *Where* we determine where particular crops and crop varieties are.  *When* deals with determining crop calendars and crop phenology. Under *What* we discuss crop yield and the presence of crop diseases. Cropping systems and management practices are treated in *How*. Finally, in *Who* we discuss data about farmers and the population in general.
