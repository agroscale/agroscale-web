Case studies
============

In this section we present a number of case studies that implement and combine some of the techniques described in earlier sections of this book. 

In the first chapter a combination of machine learning and mechanistic models is used the response of crops to fertilizers. 

The second chapter builds on that, and on estimated input and output prices to estimate the profitability of fertilizer use. 

In the third chapter, the potential benefit of a new variety is evaluated. 

In the fourth chapter, approaches to estimating climate change effects are discussed. 

Chapter five evaluated the effect of diversification and biofortification on local diets.
