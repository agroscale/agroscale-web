Case studies
============

Here we present a number of case studies. In these studies the tecniques described in earlier parts of this book come together. 


In the first chapter a combination of machine learning and mechanistic models is used to estimate input (fertilizer) and output (maize) prices. The second chapter discussed approaches to estimate crop calendars (planting and harvesting times).
Chapter three shows approaches to estimate yield potential using simulation and regression models. Chapter four shows an example of an empirical "big data" approach to estimate the response to fertilizer. 

In the fourth chapter, approaches to estimating climate change effects are discussed.
