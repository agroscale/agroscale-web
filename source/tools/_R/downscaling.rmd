# Downscaling

We often have data for relatively large areas and we would like to estimate values at a higher spatial resolution. A typical example is census-type data on agricultural production or income. This is often provided for large administrative areas. Here we illustrate approaches to estimate higher resolution data from these coarse resolution data.

## crop area



## income and poverty
