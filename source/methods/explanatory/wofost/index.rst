WOFOST
======

WOFOST is a computer model that simulates growth and development of annual field crops (`de Wit et al., 2019 <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X17310107?via%3Dihub>`_). It can be used to estimate potential crop productivity for a given variety, and under specified soil and weather conditions. Such estimates are the basis for the analysis of variability and trends in crop yields, benefits of new agricultural technology (varieties in particular), and for understanding options for regional agricultural production.

In this subsections we first briefly describe some of the the `concepts or algorithms <principles.html>`_  on which the model is based. In the second chapter we show an `example model run <example.html>`_. The following chapters desribe the model input (`weather data <weather.html>1_) and `crop <crop.html>`_, soil <soil.html>`_ and <control.html>`_ in detail. The last chapter discusses the model output.
