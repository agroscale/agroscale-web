Rule-based models
=================

In this section we discuss rule-based models. In our terminology these are models with a mathematical structure that is imposed by the model developer, based on a presumed partial understanding of the proces of interest. Given the model structure, model parameters may be based on from experiments or from model tuning with known input and output data. Under this definition, a linear regression model may be considered a very simple example of a rule-based model, but here we concerned with models that are a bit more complex. 

The first sub-section discussed dynamic `crop growth simulation <simulation.html>`__  models. These models are particularly useful as a tool to further our understanding of the processes influencing crop growth, but they can also be used for prediction. For example, you may use them to estimate crop yield under a variety of environmental conditions and crop management. The second sub-section discusses the `QUEFTS <quefts.html>`__  model. QUEFTS is a relatively simple model that predicts the response of crops to fertilizer. The third sub-section describes the use of `disease models <disease.html>`__.
