QUEFTS
======

This sub-section has two chapters about the `QUEFTS` model. QUEFTS is a rule-based model to estimate crop yield given a few soil properties and the amount of fertilizer applied, or to estimate the amount of fertilizer needed to reach a particular yield. The first chapter provides an `introduction to the basic ideas <quefts.html>`__ of the model, and the input and output. The second chapter shows how to use with spatial data on soil properties to make `predictions for regions <quefts_spatial.html>`__.
