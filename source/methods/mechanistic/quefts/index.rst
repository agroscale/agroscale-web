QUEFTS
======

This sub-section has two chapters about the ``QUEFTS`` model. QUEFTS stands for *QUantitative Evaluation of the Fertility of Tropical Soils*. It is a
simple rule-based model to estimate crop yield given a few soil properties and the amount of fertilizer applied, or to estimate the amount of fertilizer needed to reach a particular yield.

QUEFTS was first described in: **B.H. Janssen, F.C.T. Guiking, D. van der Eijk, E.M.A. Smaling, J. Wolf and H.van Reuler. 1990. A system for
quantitative evaluation of the fertility of tropical soils (QUEFTS).**\ `Geoderma 46: 299-318 <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/001670619090021Z>`__.
