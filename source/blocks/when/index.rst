When?
=====

It is often important to know the timing of key stages in crop development: planting, flowering, and harvest. In this chapter we show methods to estimate these events with three different approaches. The first chapter shows how a simple `algorithm <algorithm.html>`_ that uses monthly rainfall can be used. The next chapters show increasingly complex approaches with the `ecocrop model <ecocrop.html>` and with a crop growth `simulation model <simulation.html>`_. In chapter four, satellite `remote sensing <remotesensing.html>`_ data is used. In the final chapter we `compare <compare.html>`_ and discuss results obtained with these methods with data from crop calendar databases.
