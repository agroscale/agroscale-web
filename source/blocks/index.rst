Building blocks
===============

In this section we show the application of tools and methods to produce intermediate data products that form the building blocks in regional agronomy research and development. They are organized by the questions *Where*, *When*, *What* and *Who*. The idea is that the answers to these questions provide data products that can help us answering the more important questions *Why* and *What if* -- but we leave these to another section (case studies).

In *Where* we determine where particular crops and crop varieties are.  *When* deals with determining crop calendars and crop phenology. Under *What* we discuss crop yield and the presence of crop diseases, and prices. Finally, in *Who* we discuss data about farmers and the population in general.
