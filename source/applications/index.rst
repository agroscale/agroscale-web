Applications
============

In this section we present a number of selected topics that illustrate much of what was discussed in the "tools and methods" section. The chapters show how particular tools can be used and integrated to produce data products. These use of these data products is illustrated in the case studies in the next section.

In the first chapter a combination of machine learning and mechanistic models is used to estimate input (fertilizer) and output (maize) prices. The second chapter discussed approaches to estimate crop calendars (planting and harvesting times).
Chapter three shows approaches to estimate yield potential using simulation and regression models. Chapter four shows an example of an empirical "big data" approach to estimate the response to fertilizer. In the final chapter, approaches to estimating climate change effects are discussed.
